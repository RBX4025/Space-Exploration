    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>The global space economy is undergoing a profound transformation, transitioning from a historically government-dominated sector to one increasingly led by private enterprise. AI technologies serve as the catalytic force enabling this shift, empowering autonomy, scalability, and operational optimization. This briefing outlines the trajectory of space activity, the evolution of key AI products, and six strategic domains that will define the economic and technological fabric of the next frontier. The timeline from 2025 to 2060 is identified as the critical inflection window.</p>

    <h2>Assumptions Behind the Original Space Activity Chart</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The 'Government Activity' line assumes a linear decline in public-led innovation and funding.</li>
      <li>The 'Commercial Activity' line assumes exponential growth from capital, innovation, and demand.</li>
      <li>Regulatory frameworks remain favorable to private sector expansion.</li>
      <li>Technological breakthroughs are paced through the 2030s and 2040s.</li>
      <li>Stable geopolitical and economic conditions persist through 2100.</li>
    </ul>
